A few weeks ago, right as Snap Inc started selling them online, I decided to purchase a pair 
of Snapchat Spectacles. For those unaware on what these are they are a pair of sunglasses 
that come with bluetooth, wifi, a camera and a button. They allow you to take point of view 
recordings up to 30 seconds in length to share on Snapchat. One of the key values of what these 
give you over just using your phone to share videos to Snapchat is their circular video.

Here is a quick sample of what the video looks like outside of Snapchat:

<div class="has-video">
  <video
    src="/static/videos/specs.mp4"
    controls
    loop
    autoplay
  ></video>
</div>

Inside the app when watching some of this video you can tilt your phone to see more of the video 
outside of classical landscape or portrait field of view.

Spectacles were one of the most hyped announcments of Snapchat's parent company Snap Inc, as with 
everything that the company does a large audience always seem to get really excited for it.
