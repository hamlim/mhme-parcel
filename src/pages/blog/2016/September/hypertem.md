I recently decided to give <a href="https://hyperterm.org/">HyperTerm</a> a try. For the fun of it I also decided to install Hyperpower, an extension for the terminal. *Sorry for the low quality video 😦*.

<div class="has-video">
  <video src="/static/assets/videos/hyperpower.mp4" class="video" controls></video>
</div>

For the fun of it I also turned on `wow` mode and decided to install a few packages via npm. The results totally made it worth using HyperTerm.
